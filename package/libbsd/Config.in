	  libbsd - Utility functions from BSD systems

	  This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems,
	  and lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port
	  projects with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same
	  code over and over again on each project.
