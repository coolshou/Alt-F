<title>Alt-F Packages Help</title>
</head><body>

<center><h2>Alt-F Package Manager Help</h2></center>

<p>This page allows you to add functionalities to Alt-F, by downloading packages from the
Internet and installing them on disk.
<p>You need a working internet connection; if you need to use a proxy server, set it first using
Setup->Proxy.

<p>On the first time you reach the page you will be presented with the default package feeds and
asked where on disk you want to install the packages.<br>
To <strong>disable</strong> a package feed its checkbox should be checked.<br>
You can change the address of the packages origin, in case you want to setup your own package feed.<br>
After you select a filesystem, a directory called 'Alt-F' (not 'alt-f', case is  significant) will be created and the 'ipkg' package will be downloaded and installed.

<p>You will then be presented with the filesystems where the Alt-F folders where found and which is currently active. When the first Alt-F folder is found at boot time at the base of a filesystem, it will be used and activated.<br>
You can boot disable, deactivate, copy and delete Alt-F folders from each shown filesystem; deactivating or deleting is not always possible, as it might be in use (try first to stop all services first (System->Utilities, Services, StopAll)). As a last resource you can Boot Disable it, Submit and reboot, and you will then able to manipulate it at your will. Remember that packages that you have installed on disk will not be available.

<p>You will then be presented with the list of pre-installed, installed and available packages that you can update, remove or install.
You can read the simplified description of the package functionality and visit the package
homepage for further information (some will be blank).

<p>You can install and remove packages by hitting the corresponding buttons.
Many packages depends on others, and all needed packages will be automatically installed.

<p>You can't remove a package that is needed by others, you have to remove the main package first.

<p>When the "Remove" button for a package is grayed out, it means that the package is pre-installed on the firmware and can't be uninstalled; when updating that package the "Remove" button becomes enabled, and if latter the package is deleted the pre-installed version in the firmware will again be available.

<p>Removing a package does not necessary means a fresh start, as some configuration or package created files are not deliberately removed, because they might have been changed by the user; for a really fresh start you have to remove all packages and restart anew. The "RemoveAll" button is intended for that purpose, but it might fail at first, use it right after a reboot.

<p>From time to time new packages are made available or existing packages are updated. For the
changes to appear, you have to hit the <em>UpdatePackageList</em> button. When a package is Updated, its configuration files are not lost, so you don't loose your settings.

<p>Some packages, mostly those that are for direct user usage, have administrative web pages.
Depending on the package functionality, you will find its web page under Services->Network,
Services->System or Services->User; in same cases the package web page will be accessed though one of the main menus, look for changes there also.

<p>The packages administrative web pages are simple by nature and design, trying to cover
the most frequent needs. You can also edit the packages configuration files directly,
if you dare. It is not however guaranteed that your manual changes will be recognized
or preserved by the administrative web pages if you use them afterward.
