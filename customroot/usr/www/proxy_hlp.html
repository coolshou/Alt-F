<center><h2>WGet Proxy Setup Help</h2></center>

<p>If you want to install Alt-F or ffp packages, the box needs to be connected to the internet in order to download them.<br>
The package downloading is done using the 'wget' program, and if you need to use a proxy server to connect to the internet you must configure it in this page, that only sets the 'wget' proxy settings.

<p>If you don't need a proxy, you can skip this page, otherwise check the "Use a Proxy" checkbox and fill-in the proxy host names and ports for the HTTP and FTP protocols.

<p>If you need to authenticate with the proxy servers, check the "Anonymous Proxy" checkbox and fill-in your username and password for them.

<p>Password can have ASCII letters, numbers and any character from the set <tt>!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~</tt>.<br>
