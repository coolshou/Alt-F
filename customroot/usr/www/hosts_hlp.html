<center><h2>Local Network Hosts Help</h2></center>

<p>Every computer in a network must have an assigned IP address. An IP address has the
form x.x.x.x, where x lies between 1 and 254.<br>

It is also convenient to assign a name to a computer, in order to not
have to remember its IP address when one desires to communicate with it.</p>

<p>In this page, you establish the relationship between host name and
host IP address for computers in the local network that have a fixed IP address.</p>

<p>Computers can also have dynamically assigned IP addresses, where its IP address is not
fixed but assigned on-demand by a DHCP server. Usually the DHCP server
lies in the modem/router that connects you to the internet.<br>

Alt-F also has a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server that
you can configure in the  Services -> Network-> dnsmask web page.</p>
