<center><h2>inetd Setup</h2></center>

<p>inetd is a super-server that launches on demand other servers such as ssh or ftp.
<p>This means that only one server (inetd) is continuously running, saving system resources such as CPU and memory for other usages; that is particularly important on underpowered computers such as the DNS-323.
<p>The downside is that servers launched by inetd are a bit slower to start, although that is not generally human perceptible, and that the box becomes susceptible to DoS attacks. If any of these downsides is a concern, then run the servers in standalone mode.

<p><strong>Service</strong>: the generic service name, as it appears in /etc/services.
<p><strong>Program</strong>: the server program to be launched on demand.
<p><strong>Enable</strong>: enables the service to be under inetd control.
<ul><li>For a service to be under inetd control, the checkbox must be checked; changes are applied when the Submit button is pressed.</li>
<li>When the checkbox is grayed (disabled) this means that the service has its own configuration webUI, where it can be put under inetd control or be run as a standalone server (in this case it will appear under Services->Network)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Configure</strong>: allows to specifically configure the server program.
