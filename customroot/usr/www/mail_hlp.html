<center><h2>Mail Setup Help</h2></center>

<p>In this page you can setup a mail server and mail recipient where you
want Alt-F to send e-mails for system warnings. 

<p>You have to specify in "Server Name" and "Server Port" the name and
port of the mail server that will accept e-mails sent from the box,
which by default is set to GMail.<br> The server port depends on the
protocol/server used; by default it is set to the port used by GMail for
secure transmission.<br> You must check the "TLS/SSL" checkbox if you
want to use a secure TLS or SSL channel. 

<p>If the mail server needs authentication, fill-in your username and password
and select the proper authentication method; by selecting "On" the most secure
method will be automatically chosen, but if that doesn't works you have to
experiment using the "Plain" or "Login" methods.<br>
If the specified mail server does not requires authentication, select "Anonymous".

<p>Password can have ASCII letters, numbers and any character from the
set <tt>!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~</tt>. 

<p>Fill-in the sender e-mail address in the "From" field; it must be a valid
e-mail, as some servers verify it. Other servers ignore it and use the e-mail
associated with the server account used to send the message.
 
<p>Fill-in the warning recipient e-mail address in the "To" field
and hit the "Test" button to send a test e-mail or just hit the "Submit" button
to save your changes. <br>
