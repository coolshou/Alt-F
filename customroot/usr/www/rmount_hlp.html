<center><h2>Remote NFS and CIFS Imports Setup Help</h2></center>

<p>In this page you can specify remote NFS and CIFS shares to become available to the box.<br>

A share is a network offer of an existing folder.

<ul>
<li><h4>Shares to import from other NFS servers</h4>

Specify remote folders to be locally mounted, e.g. to make them available under other protocol.
<ul>
<li><strong>Disable:</strong> Check to temporary stop mounting the share..</li>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> The remote hostname (or IP address) that exports the share.</li>
<li><strong>Folder:</strong> The remote folder to mount locally.</li>
<li><strong>Discover:</strong> Hit to NFS browse the network; hitting a line will fill the Host and Folder fields.</li>
<li><strong>Local Folder:</strong> Local folder where the remote share should be made available. 
It is recommended to use an empty folder directly under "/mnt"; if necessary create the folder, e.g. "/mnt/remoteNFS".</li>
<li><strong>Search:</strong> Hit to browse the local folder structure (and possibly create the mount folder).</li>
<li><strong>Mount Options:</strong> NFS mount options, comma separated, no spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Options:</strong> Opens a new window with a list of the most
frequently used mount options and the currently selected ones; hit CTRL while
clicking to select multiple options. Options of the form option=value
does not preserve the current value.</li>

<li><p><h4>Delay NFS start on boot:</h4> NFS stores some client information on disk, for recovery on reboot
in case of server or client crash. That information is stored in a sub-directory where Alt-F 
packages are stored. At boot time, when NFS starts, the Alt-F directory might not yet be available
and such recovery information is missing.<br>Checking this checkbox delays the NFS start until the
Alt-F directory becomes available. Notice that if the checkbox is checked and the Alt-F directory
never appears, then NFS will not auto-start.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><h4>Shares to import from other CIFS servers</h4>
You can make other computer shares available to the box.<br>

<ul>
<li><strong>Host</strong> - the computer name where the share is available.<br>
If empty, the whole entry will be removed when the Submit button is hit.</li>

<li><strong>Share</strong> - the remote share name.<br>
If empty, the whole entry will be removed when the Submit button is hit.</li>

<li><strong>Discover</strong> - opens a new window and performs a SMB/CIFS
network scan, showing the existing computers and offered shares;
clicking a share will fill-in the previous <strong>Host</strong> and
<strong>Share</strong> entry fields.</li>

<li><strong>Local Folder</strong> - the local folder where the remote
share contents will be available.<br> If the folder is not empty, its contents
will (temporarily) disappear while the remote share is mounted, and will
reappear when the remote share is unmounted.</li>

<li><strong>Search</strong> - opens the <em>Folders Browse</em> window, which will
fill-in the Local Folder entry field with the selected folder.</li>

<li><strong>Mount Options</strong> - specify the desired mount options;
the default values will generally be OK.</li>

</ul>
</li></ul>

After an entry is filled-in and the Submit button is hit, a
<strong>Mount</strong> button will appear, which will make the remote
share locally available; when <em>mounted</em>, an
<strong>unMount</strong> button will appear instead, which if selected will unmount
(unmap) the remote share.
