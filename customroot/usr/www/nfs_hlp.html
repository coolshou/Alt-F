<center><h2>NFS Setup Help</h2></center>

<p>In this page you can configure NFS, allowing UNIX computers to access
this box shares.<br>

A share is a network offer of an existing folder.

<ul>
<li><h4>Folders to export to other hosts</h4>
Specifies folders that can be NFS mounted by other computers. Only NFS-v3 is supported.

<ul>
<li><strong>Disable:</strong> Check to temporary stop exporting the share.</li>

<li><strong>Folder:</strong> The folder to export.
<strong>Note:</strong> To export the same folder to different hosts with
different options, enter the same folder on different lines for each host.</li>

<li><strong>Search:</strong> Hit to browse the local folder structure. 
Hitting "OK" will fill-in the Folder field. </li>

<li><strong>Allowed hosts:</strong> the hosts allowed to mount the share. Can be:
<ul>
<li>anonymous: a single * character will match all clients.</li>
<li>single host: a host name setup under Setup->Hosts, or an IP address</li>
<li>IP networks: a (sub) network specified by address/netmask</li>
<li>wildcards: wildcard characters * and ?, or class lists within [square brackets]. </li>
<li>netgroups: NIS  netgroups  may be given as @group (not supported)</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Export Options:</strong> Any NFS allowed option, comma separated, no spaces.</li>

<li><strong>Options:</strong> Opens a new window with a list of the most
frequently used options and the currently selected ones; hit CTRL while
clicking to select multiple options. Options of the form option=value
does not preserve the current value. </li>

</ul></li>

<li><p><h4>Delay NFS start on boot:</h4> NFS stores some client information on disk, for recovery on reboot
in case of server or client crash. That information is stored in a sub-directory where Alt-F 
packages are stored. At boot time, when NFS starts, the Alt-F directory might not yet be available
and such recovery information is missing.<br>Checking this checkbox delays the NFS start until the
Alt-F directory becomes available. Notice that if the checkbox is checked and the Alt-F directory
never appears, then NFS will not auto-start.</li>

<li><p><h4>Clean stale entries:</h4>Due to client or server crash, the information on remote mounts might be innacurate. Checking this checkbox removes remote mount entries at service start.</li>

<li><p><h4>Max NFS Block size:</h4> Allows specifying the max NFS block size in bytes, potentially improving NFS throughput.<br>
Specifying too high values will reduce the amount of memory available for other OS sub-systems, such as page/file caching, and the overall effect can be negative. If not specified 32KB is used on boxes with less then 256MB of memory. The default kernel value is calculated in a conservative way as RAM_size/4096 KB.</li>
