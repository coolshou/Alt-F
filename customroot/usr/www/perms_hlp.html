<title>Folder Permissions Help</title>

<center><h2>Folder Owner and Group<br>
and Access Permissions Help</h2></center>

<p>A user belongs to a main group and, optionally, to one or more
secondary groups. 

<p>When you create a user in the Users and Groups web page, it is
automatically added to the "users" group, which is its main group.  You
can later add, in the same web page, a user to one or more secondary
groups. 

<p>A directory, or folder, belongs to a user and a group.

<p>In this page, you can change the owner and group of a folder.<br>
You can also set read, write and browse permissions for the folder
owner, the users that belong to the folder group, and for all other
users.

<p>The difference between read and browse permissions is that with browse
permissions one is only able to see the folder contents, not access
(read) the files on it.<br>

Having the read but not the browse permissions allows one to access
(read) a file if one knows its name, even if one could not obtain the
folder listing. 

<p>A folder can also have what is called a "set-group-ID" flag; when that flag is set,
new files or folders created in it will belong to the folder owner, i.e, they will
inherit group ownership. This flag, if set, will be automatically set to new sub-folders.<br>
If the "Make new files/folders inherit the group ownership" checkbox is checked, this flag will be set.

<p>Suppose that you have a folder that belongs to user Alice and group
Video.<br>

Suppose also that the Video group has users Bob and Carol on it, but
not the Dave user.<br>

If the folder owner permissions are read and browse, but not write,
then Alice can read and browse the folder, but not write on it, which
is odd but possible.  Alice is also not able to create or delete any
files on it.<br>

If the folder group permissions are write and browse, then Bob and
Carol can browse the folder but not read its files, although they can
delete and create files on it.<br>

If none of the "other users" permissions are set, than Dave can not even
browse the folder.<br>

If the folder has the "set-group-ID" flag set and Bob creates a new file on
it, the new file will belong to the Video group, and not to the group
that Bob belongs to.<br>
