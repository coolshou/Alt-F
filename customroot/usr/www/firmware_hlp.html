<title>Firmware Update Help</title>

<center><h2>Firmware Update Help</h2></center>

<p>Most processor-based devices run at boot a program that is stored in
some form of non-volatile memory.

<p>A PC, for example, has the BIOS, that is the first program that the
processor runs when it is powered-up.<br>
It is the BIOS that loads the operating system from disk; the BIOS
itself doesn't need a disk to operate. 

<p>In order to correct bugs or provide enhancements in such programs, most
manufacturers store the program in non-volatile, re-writable, flash memory.

<p>When you upgrade your box firmware from the vendor's distributed version
1.07 to 1.08, e.g., you are written a new version of the software into the flash
memory. 

<p>This process has a certain risk involved, because if something goes wrong
the box will not power up properly, and you have to return it for repair.<br>

Sometimes, but only if using a <a
href="http://wiki.dns323.info/hardware:serial"> serial-port</a>
connection to the box, it is  possible to recover from the error, but it
is a relatively complex process.

<p>Also, flashing non vendor's distributed firmware files generally voids
the box warranty. 

<p>Alt-F Firmware Upgrade program accepts its own firmware files as well
as firmware files from the box vendor. After flashing Alt-F you can
always flash a vendor's firmware file back into your box. 

<p>The most common reasons for "something going wrong" are power losses
during the flashing, a defective new firmware, or an error in the
program that makes the writing into flash. 

<p>After uploading a file to the box, Alt-F Firmware Upgrade program
verifies its validity and only then offers you the possibility of
flashing it.<br>

<p>After verifying the correctness of the firmware file you uploaded to
the box, you are offered the possibility of flashing and trying it.

<p>If you have already flashed Alt-F in your box, you shall try the new
version before flashing it. By trying first you will be be reassured that
it works fine with your current setup, and also that it is not in error,
avoiding further serious problems.

<p>After trying it successfully, you can flash it.

<p>When you choose to flash the new firmware you should take into attention
how to deal with the settings already saved in flash, the settings
file eventually contained in the firmware file, and the backup of the vendors settings. <br>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don't Erase flashed settings</strong>: the flash saved settings are
not changed.<br>

This option is the default when flashing a firmware file without a defaults section, 
like Alt-F. You should use it if you want to keep yours Alt-F flash saved settings.</li>

<li><strong>Erase all flashed settings</strong>: all saved settings are
erased from flash, and all yours previous setting are lost.<br>

This option should be chosen when flashing Alt-F but only if you want to
loose the previous settings. Configuration files structure sometime
change between releases, and using an old configuration file with new
software might cause problems.</li>

<li><strong>Erase all flashed settings and flash new settings from
defaults file</strong>: Besides doing the same as the above option, if
you select this option the settings contained in the defaults file extracted
from the firmware file are also flashed.<br>

Vendors distributed firmware files have a section of defaults setting,
that are flashed if you check this option. This option is only available
is there exists a non-empty defaults section -- Alt-F firmware doesn't
have a defaults section.<br>

This option should be chosen when flashing the vendors firmware.</li>

<li><strong>Erase all flashed settings and recover the last flash settings
from vendors backup</strong>: Selecting this options erases all flashed settings,
and flashes the last vendor's made backup of flashed settings.
<br>

The vendor's firmware saves a backup of the flashed settings in a special area
of the flash chip. Selecting this option recovers those backup settings, and in principle
after re-flashing a vendors firmware the box will have the same settings as it had before
you flashed Alt-F.<br>

This option is only available is there exists a non-empty defaults section,
meaning that it is a vendors file. Alt-F firmware doesn't have a defaults section.</li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, saving default settings or clearing the saved settings,
makes your box loose its IP address, and it will probably not be accessible
using the old IP address.<br><br>
